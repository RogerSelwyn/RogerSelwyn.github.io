# RTP Enterprises

Ever since my days in school, I have gone by the acronym RTP and where I develop for other prople I will tend to mark my work with `RTP Enterprises`. Back in school that stood for 'Rog the Programmer', where I started my computing career writing basic on Commodore PETs. Since then I spent a couple years hacking around on VAX and Prime computers before finding a career in IT initially doing programming at Rolls-Royce Aerospace Engines.

To say I get enjoyment from messing around on computers is an understatement. I've always wanted to try and make them do as much as I can do with my variable skills, most of which is self taught. The pleasure I get in getting something complex to work is immense and acts as a real form of relaxation.

These days, in the most part I'm not doing 'IT' for payment, but of course when someone wants to buy me a coffee/beer that is always appreciated. I do take on the odd job, whether fixing a computer or creating a website, but mostly its to squeeze the best out of the stuff I'm working on today.

Currently I'm working on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), frustrating my family, automating my home in smaller and bigger ways. I look after a couple of integrations, and do most of my automation in [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) using the core HA add-on.
