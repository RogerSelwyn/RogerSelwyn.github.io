# Home Assistant

I currently look after several integrations. These were initially developed by others, but then other priorities took over, so I've taken them on to keep them alive:

- Sky Q component for Home Assistant - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/Home_Assistant_SkyQ_MediaPlayer) - [Documentation](https://rogerselwyn.github.io/Home_Assistant_SkyQ_MediaPlayer/)
- Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/O365-HomeAssistant) - [Documentation](https://rogerselwyn.github.io/O365-HomeAssistant/)
- Sky Hub - [GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/sky_hub) - [Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sky_hub/)

Also I have created the API libraries that underpin the Sky integrations:
- pyskyqremote - Used by Sky Q component for Home Assistant - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/skyq_remote)
- pyskyqhub - Used by Sky Hub - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/skyq_hub)

In addition I irregularly publish my Home Assistant Configs:
- Home - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/Home_Assistant_Config)
- Ty'r Celyn - [GitHub](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/Home_Assistant_Tyr_Celyn_Config)
